## Project thoughts

I am interested in exploring data related to political instability in West Africa. I wrote an article last month for HIR on Operation Barkhane, which is a French anti-terrorism force in the region. As of August this year, the military force has evacuated Mali. I am interested in how these changes have impacted the Sahel.
